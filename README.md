# Double Machine Learning: applications in Political Science

**Course**: Recent Developments in Political Methodology

**Instructor**: Naoki Egami

**Semester**: Fall 2025

**Authors**:

- Fanisi Mbozi
- Gabrielle Péloquin-Skulski
- Clemente Sánchez

**Description**: This repository contains code and materials for replicating key results from two recent papers in Political Science, as well as extending their results using DML. The two papers being replicated are:

- Platas, M. R., & Raffler, P. J. (2021). Closing the gap: Information and mass support in a dominant party regime. The Journal of Politics, 83(4), 1619-1634.
- Brierley, S., & Nathan, N. L. (2022). Motivating the machine: Which brokers do parties pay?. The Journal of Politics, 84(3), 1539-1555.

## Repository overview

  - `dml_*`: code for replication and DML
  - `scratch_*`: code that we tried at some point
- `figures`: exported figures with the results
- `presentation`: slides for the presentation, connected to Overleaf
- `papers`: original PDFs of the papers we are replicating
- `replication_package_*`: replication packages for each paper
